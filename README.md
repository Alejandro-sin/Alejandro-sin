# About my self

Always learning for the love of learning, artist for passion, chemist by profession, and data scientist progressing toward mastery.

The leitmotif of my life is to learn, create and share with everyone as an exercise in learning and personal growth, I believe in the power of science and technology but I am also aware of the gap between who thinks and who decides, I think of myself as a bridge builder between this gap, someone who loves software development, literature and believes that if knowledge is power, data is potential.
